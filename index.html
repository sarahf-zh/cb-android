   <b> CareBridge </b> is an Android app designed to address the HealthCare accessibility gap, by providing underrepresented community with the tools and info to access basic healthcare. It allows users to chat with a doctor-like AI agent to get medical diagnosis and find nearby healthcare providers via a customized map that is easily accessible for visually impaired users. The source code for CareBridge is located in [https://github.com/sarahf-zh/my-android/tree/main/CareBridge](https://github.com/sarahf-zh/my-android/tree/main/CareBridge).
