<h2>Welcome To CareBridge!</h2>
<p>CareBridge is a youth-led initiative to bridge healthcare accessibility gaps through multiple avenues including AI technology. Why CareBridge? At least half of the world's population lacks access to quality healthcare, and approximately one hundred million people cannot afford high healthcare costs. Furthermore, at least two billion people worldwide experience visual impairments, making everyday tasks like navigating online maps a significant challenge. Sarah Zhou launched the CareBridge initiative because she believes that access to basic health care is a human right, regardless of someone's specific conditions.</p>

<h2>The CareBridge App</h2>

<h3>Demo & GitHub Project</h3>
<p>To showcase AI's potential in tacking global health access chalelnges, Sarah Zhou built the CareBridge app, which is an AI-powered Android app designed to provide underrepresented communities with the tools and information to access basic healthcare. To see a 3.5-minute video demo of the CareBridge app, please see <a href="https://youtu.be/SSBY2XK9Ivg">here</a>. The source code for CareBridge is located <a href="https://github.com/sarahf-zh/my-android/tree/main/CareBridge">https://github.com/sarahf-zh/my-android/tree/main/CareBridge</a>.
The app features:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A doctor-like ChatBot powered by AI offering preliminary diagnosis.</li>
  <li>A set of medical advice cards with speech-to-text capability.</li>
  <li>An embedded web browser showing three online pharmacies.</li>
  <li>A customized map that is easily accessible for visually impaired users to find nearby healthcare providers.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Technologies Behind CareBridge</h3>
<p>CareBridge leverages a variety of libraries and APIs to deliver its features:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Android SDK</b>: Used for core application development, including UI design with Material Design components, map views, web views, speech to text, and view binding.</li>
  <li><b>Third-Party Libraries</b>: Utilizes libraries like Volley, Retrofit, Dagger, and Picasso for networking, dependency injection, and image loading.</li>
  <li><b>Google Cloud Dialogflow ES API</b>: Connects to a LLM (ChatGPT or Google Gemini) driven agent to power the "Doctor Bot" chat functionality.</li>
  <li><b>Google Maps Places API</b>: Enables the app to search for and display nearby health care providers based on the user's location.</li>
</ul>
