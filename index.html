<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>(1) CareBridge </b>is an Android app designed to address the HealthCare accessibility gap, by providing underrepresented community with the tools and info to access basic healthcare. It features a doctor-like ChatBot powered by AI offering preliminary diagnosis, a set of medical advice cards with speech-to-text capability, an embedded web browser showing three online pharmacies and a customized map that is easily accessible for visually impaired users to easily find nearby healthcare providers.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Why CareBridge? At least half of the world's population lacks access to quality healthcare, and approximately one hundred million people cannot afford high healthcare costs. Furthermore, at least two billion people worldwide experience visual impairments, making everyday tasks like navigating online maps a significant challenge. CareBridge's creator, Sarah Zhou, believes that access to basic health care is a human right, regardless of someone's specific conditions.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The source code for CareBridge is located <a href="https://github.com/sarahf-zh/my-android/tree/main/CareBridge"><span class="s2">here</span></a>.
